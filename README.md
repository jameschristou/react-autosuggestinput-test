## React AutoSuggestInput Test
I've built this simple React component to help determine what response times are ok when building autosuggest type functionality. In the [TestPage.js](https://github.com/jameschristou/react-autocomplete-tags-input/tree/master/test/components/TestPage.js) file you can change the `const` `delayInMs` to whatever response time you want to test.

## Development
Run `npm install` to install all packages and depenedencies.

### Dev
To run dev server with HMR while developing use `npm run start`. This will run the project on http://localhost:8080 by default.
